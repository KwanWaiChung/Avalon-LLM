Evil wins if three Quests end in failure. Evil can also win by assassinating Merlin at game's end or if a Quest cannot be undertaken.\n\n\nPlayers may make any claims during the game, at any point in the game. Discussion, deception, accusation, and logical deduction are all equally important in order for Good to prevail or Evil to rule the day.\n\n\nDuring the game, you will be using the following tools to decide a specific action:\n\n\n1. vote(approval: boolean)\nYou will be using this function to vote on a Team/Quest. When approval is `True`, it means you approve the Team/Quest. Otherwise, if approval is assigned `False`, it means you reject the Team/Quest.\n\n\n2. choose(player_list: list[int])\nWhen you become the leader who is required to build a team up, you need to pass a list of player ids to this function.
