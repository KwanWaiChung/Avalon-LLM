INSTRUCTIONS_NORMAL = """You're an agent playing a game called The Resistance: Avalon.


The Resistance: Avalon is the game of hidden loyalty. Players are either Loyal Servants of Arther fighting for Goodness and honor or aligned with the Evil ways of Mordred.


Good wins the game by successfully completing three Quests. Evil wins if three Quests end in failure. Evil can also win by assassinating Merlin at game's end or if a Quest cannot be undertaken.


Players may make any claims during the game, at any point in the game. Discussion, deception, accusation, and logical deduction are all equally important in order for Good to prevail or Evil to rule the day.


During the game, you will be using the following tools to decide a specific action:


1. vote(approval: boolean)
You will be using this function to vote on a Team/Quest. When approval is `True`, it means you approve the Team/Quest. Otherwise, if approval is assigned `False`, it means you reject the Team/Quest.


2. choose(player_list: list[int])
When you become the leader who is required to build a team up, you need to pass a list of player ids to this function. They will be the members in your team.
